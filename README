Their is really no good reason for this project, yet, here it is.

Can you really use the output in a C++ program?  Yep.

 Here is an example you can use, just copy below the line, put into a file called main.cc and replace the part that says "//Place Output from Monkey-Convert here, then compile." with the output from Monkey-Convert:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
//Place Output from Monkey-Convert here, then compile.


for (int i=0; i < sizeof(monkey) / sizeof(monkey[0]); i++){
			cout << monkey[i];
	}
return 0;
}
